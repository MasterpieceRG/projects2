    <string name="Pepperoni_Pizza">There’s a reason this is one of the most popular types of pizza. Who doesn’t love biting into a crispy, salty round of pepperoni?</string>
    <string name="Meat_Pizza">If pepperoni just isn’t enough, and you’re looking for a pie with a bit more heft, a meat pizza is a perfect and popular choice. Pile on ground beef and sausage for a hearty meal.</string>

    <string name="BBQ_Chicken_Pizza">If you love BBQ chicken and you love pizza, why not put them together? This has long been a cult favorite of sports fans and college kids. The chicken slathered over the top of a pie gives it a tangy, sweet flavor that can’t be beaten.</string>

    <string name="Supreme_Pizza">When you can’t decide which toppings to get, it’s time for the supreme pizza.

    <string name="The_Works_Pizza">And when the supreme just isn’t enough, you’re ready for the works. It’s a step up in heartiness from the supreme. The “works” usually involves a wide variety of veggie toppings including onions, olives, and mushrooms, plus bacon and pepperoni.</string>
